This technique enumerates all storage accounts and collects critical security information including account names, resource IDs, and public access settings. The discovery of storage accounts is particularly valuable for attackers as these resources often contain sensitive business data, application backups, virtual machine disks, and other critical assets. The technique specifically identifies storage accounts with blob public access enabled, which may indicate security misconfigurations that could be exploited for unauthorized data access. The enumerated information serves as a foundation for other attack techniques like key extraction, public access exploitation, shared access signature (SAS) abuse, or container enumeration. Storage account naming patterns discovered through this technique can also reveal information about associated applications, environments, or organizational structure.",
